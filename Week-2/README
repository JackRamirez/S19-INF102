COMPILE:
    g++ -std=c++11 -o five five.cpp
    g++ -std=c++11 -o six six.cpp
    
RUN:
    ./five "../pride-and-prejudice.txt"
    ./six "../pride-and-prejudice.txt"
   
ABOUT:
five.cpp - Pipeline
    Constraints:
        1. Larger problem is decomposed using functionl abstraction. Functions take input, and produce output.
        2. No shared state between functions.
        3. The larger problem is solved by composing functions one after the other, in pipeline, as a faithful reproduction of mathematical function composition f â—¦ g.

 six.cpp - Code golf (brevity)
    Constraints:
        1. As few lines of code as possible.
