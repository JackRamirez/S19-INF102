ABOUT:
eight.cpp - Kick Forward (variation of Pipeline)
    Constraints:
        1. Each function takes an additional parameter, usually the last, which is another function.
        2. That function parameter is applied at the end of the current function.
        3. That function parameter is given, as input, what would be the output of the current function.
        4. The larger problem is solved as a pipeline of functions, but where the next function to be applied is given as parameter to the current function.
        
nine.java - The One
    Constraints:
         1. Existence of an abstraction to which values can be converted.
         2. This abstraction provides operations to (1) wrap around values, so that they become the abstraction; (2) bind itself to functions, so to establish
            sequences of functions; and (3) unwrap the value, so to examine the final result.
         3. Larger problem is solved as a pipeline of functions bound together, with unwrapping happening at the end.
         4. Particularly for The One style, the bind operation simply calls the given function, giving it the value that it holds, and holds on to the returned
            value.
