NOTE:
    I used a third-party Generator.java file in order to implement 
    "yield" functionality for Java.
        1) Generator.java + all accompanying files
    I do not take any credit for their creation and/or function.
    Each file should be properly cited.    
    
ABOUT:
twentynine.java - Dataspaces
    Constraints:
        1. Existence of one or more units that execute concurrently.
        2. Existence of one or more data spaces where concurrent units store and retrieve data.
        3. No direct data exchanges between the concurrent units, other than via the data spaces.

thirtyone.java - Double Map Reduce
    Constraints:
        1. Input data is divided in blocks.
        2. A map function applies a given worker function to each block of data, potentially in parallel.
        3. The results of the many worker functions are reshuffled.
        4. The reshuffled blocks of data are given as input to a second map function that takes a reducible function as input.
        5. Optional step: a reduce function takes the results of the many worker functions and recombines them into a coherent output.
