COMPILE:
    mcs -out:twentyseven.exe twentyseven.cs
    javac twentyeight.java

    
RUN:
    mono twentyseven.exe "../pride-and-prejudice.txt"
    java twentyeight "../pride-and-prejudice.txt"


NOTE:
    The twentyeight.java program runs quickly, but due to concurrency issues and multithreading,
    it may be necessary to quit program and re-run it (^C to quit) if the program hangs and solution is not immediate.
    
ABOUT:
twentyseven.cs - Lazy Rivers
    Constraints:
        1. Data is available in streams, rather than as a complete whole.
        2. Functions are filters/transformers from one kind of data stream to another.
        3. Data is processed from upstream on a need basis from downstream.
    
twentyeight.java - Actors (similar to Letterbox, but independent threads of execution)
    Constraints:
        1. The larger problem is decomposed into things that make sense for the problem domain.
        2. Each thing has a queue meant for other things to place messages in it.
        3. Each thing is a capsule of data that exposes only its ability to receive messages via the queue.
        4. Each thing has its own thread of execution independent of the others.
