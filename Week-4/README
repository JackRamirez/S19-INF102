ABOUT:
eleven.cpp - Letterbox
    Constraints:
        1. The larger problem is decomposed into things that make sense for the problem domain.
        2. Each thing is a capsule of data that exposes one single procedure, namely the ability to receive and dispatch messages that are sent to it.
        3. Message dispatch can result in sending the message to another capsule.

twelve.cpp - Closed Maps
    Constraints:
        1. The larger problem is decomposed into things that make sense for the problem domain.
        2. Each thing is a map from keys to values. Some values are procedures/functions.
        3. The procedures/functions close on the map itself by referring to its slots.
