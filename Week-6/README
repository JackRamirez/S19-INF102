ABOUT:
    I used a couple of third-party java resources for dealing with .jar files:
        1) JarResources.java
        2) MultiClassLoader.java
        3) JarClassLoader.class
    I do not take any credit for their creation and/or function.
    Each file should be properly cited.
    
seventeen.java - Reflective
    Constraints:
        1. The program has access to information about itself, i.e. introspection.
        2. The program can modify itself â€“ adding more abstractions, variables, etc. at runtime.
        
nineteen.java - Plugins
    Constraints:
        1. The problem is decomposed using some form of abstraction (procedures, functions, objects, etc.).
        2. All or some of those abstractions are physically encapsulated into their own, usually pre-compiled, packages. Main program and each of the
            packages are compiled independently. These packages are loaded dynamically by the main program, usually in the beginning (but not necessarily).
        3. Main program uses functions/objects from the dynamically-loaded packages, without knowing which exact implementations will be used. New
            implementations can be used without having to adapt or recompile the main program.
        4. Existence of an external specification of which packages to load. This can be done by a configuration file, path conventions, user input or other
           mechanisms for external specification of code to be loaded at runtime
