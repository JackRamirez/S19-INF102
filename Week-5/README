COMPILE:
    g++ -std=c++11 -o fourteen fourteen.cpp
    g++ -std=c++11 -o fifteen fifteen.cpp
    
RUN:
    ./fourteen "../pride-and-prejudice.txt"
    ./fifteen "../pride-and-prejudice.txt"
    python3.7 twentythree.py "../pride-and-prejudice.txt"
    
    
MYPY:
    I could not figure out how to run mypy with my python file, although
    I did manage to download it into ~/home/user/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/mypy directory.
    When I run "mypy twentythree.py "../pride-and-prejudice.txt"" I get a "mypy: command not found".
    
    I cannot change or add PATH/env variables using the dockerimage stack that I initiallized this workspace with from the dashboard's
    env variables tab in the workspace configuration.
    
    Instead I used this website: https://mypy-play.net/
    I copy/pasted my code, used flags that disallowed most "Any" generic types (except --isallow-any-expr), and it succeeded.
