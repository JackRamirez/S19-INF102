COMPILE:
    g++ -std=c++11 -o fourteen fourteen.cpp
    g++ -std=c++11 -o fifteen fifteen.cpp
    
RUN:
    ./fourteen "../pride-and-prejudice.txt"
    ./fifteen "../pride-and-prejudice.txt"
    python3.7 twentythree.py "../pride-and-prejudice.txt"
    
    
MYPY:
    I could not figure out how to run mypy with my python file, although
    I did manage to download it into ~/home/user/.local/lib/python3.5/site-packages/mypy directory.
    When I run "mypy twentythree.py "../pride-and-prejudice.txt"" I get a "mypy: command not found".
    
    I cannot change or add PATH/env variables using the dockerimage stack that I initiallized this workspace with from the dashboard's
    env variables tab in the workspace configuration. [EDIT 4/14/2020 - This was using Codenvy.io environment]
    
    Instead I used this website: https://mypy-play.net/
    I copy/pasted my code, used flags that disallowed most "Any" generic types (except --isallow-any-expr), and it succeeded.
    
ABOUT:
fourteen.cpp - Hollywood
    Constraints:
        1. Larger problem is decomposed into entities using some form of abstraction (objects, modules or similar).
        2. The entities are never called on directly for actions.
        3. The entities provide interfaces for other entities to be able to register callbacks.
        4. At certain points of the computation, the entities call on the other entities that have registered for callbacks.
    Additional features:
        1.  Changed the program so that it implements an additional task: after printing out the list of 25 top words, it should
            print out the number of non-stop words with the letter z. Additional constraints: (i) no changes should be made to the existing classes; adding
            new classes and more lines of code to the main function is allowed; (ii) files should be read only once for both term-frequency and “words with
            z” tasks.

fifteen.cpp - Bulletin Board
    Constraints:
        1. Larger problem is decomposed into entities using some form of abstraction (objects, modules or similar).
        2. The entities are never called on directly for actions.
        3. Existence of an infrastructure for publishing and subscribing to events, aka the bulletin board.
        4. Entities post event subscriptions (aka “wanted”) to the bulletin board and publish events (aka “offered”) to the bulletin board. The bulletin
           board infrastructure does all the event management and distribution.
    Additional features:
        1.  Changed the program so that it implements an additional task: after printing out the list of 25 top words, it should
            print out the number of non-stop words with the letter z. Additional constraints: (i) no changes should be made to the existing classes; adding
            new classes and more lines of code to the main function is allowed; (ii) files should be read only once for both term-frequency and “words with
            z” tasks.
