    DELETE "database.db"
    RE-COMPILE twentyfive.java

    WAIT approx. 10 minutes
    "database.db" should re-appear and RE-RUN should produce the same results    
    
ABOUT:
twentyfive.java - Persistent Tables
    Constraints:
        1. The data exists beyond the execution of programs that use it, and is meant to be used by many different programs.
        2. The data is stored in a way that makes it easier/faster to explore. For example:
            a. The input data of the problem is modeled as one or more series of domains, or types, of data.
            b. The concrete data is modeled as having components of several domains, establishing relationships between the applicationâ€™s data
               and the domains identified.
        3. The problem is solved by issuing queries over the data.
 
 twentysix.cpp - Spreadsheet
    Constraints:
        1. The problem is modeled like a spreadsheet, with columns of data and formulas.
        2. Some data depends on other data according to formulas. When data changes, the dependent data also changes automatically.
